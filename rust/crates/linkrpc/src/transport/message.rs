//! The `MessageTransport` trait — a bidirectional pump of messages. Higher layers
//! (`Channel`, connection, hub) are written against this seam; concrete transports
//! (in-memory pair, Unix sockets with NDJSON framing, …) implement it.
//!
//! The trait is **generic over the payload**, defaulting to the wire [`JsonRpcMessage`].
//! `Out` is what this endpoint sends, `In` what it receives — usually the same type, but
//! the split lets a transport carry a richer payload (e.g. the hub's `MuxEnvelope`, or an
//! out-of-band context wrapper that attaches provenance / headers without touching the wire
//! bytes). Per-send configuration will ride in a future `SendOpts`, never in the payload
//! type itself.
